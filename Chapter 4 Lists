Comma Code
Say you have a list value like this:
spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']
Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns
a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with and
inserted before the last item. For example, passing the previous spam list to
the function would return 'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats'. But your function
should be able to work with any list value passed to it. Be sure to test
the case where an empty list [] is passed to your function.

spam1 = []
spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']

def list2String(parameter):
    combine = ''
    for i in range(len(parameter)):
        if i == len(parameter)-1:
            combine += 'and '
            combine += parameter[i]
        else:
            combine += parameter[i]
            combine += ', '
    return combine
        

print(list2String(spam))
#print(list2String(spam1))    //case of empty list

#Another way
#Look explanation in this link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38824634/automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python-comma-code
spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']
def list_thing(words):
    if len(words) == 1:
        return words[0]
    return '{}, and {}'.format(', '.join(words[:-1]), words[-1])
    
print(list_thing(spam))

Coin Flip Streaks
For this exercise, we’ll try doing an experiment. If you flip a coin 100 times
and write down an “H” for each heads and “T” for each tails, you’ll create
a list that looks like “T T T T H H H H T T.” If you ask a human to make
108 Chapter 4
up 100 random coin flips, you’ll probably end up with alternating headtail
results like “H T H T H H T H T T,” which looks random (to humans),
but isn’t mathematically random. A human will almost never write down
a streak of six heads or six tails in a row, even though it is highly likely
to happen in truly random coin flips. Humans are predictably bad at
being random.
Write a program to find out how often a streak of six heads or a streak
of six tails comes up in a randomly generated list of heads and tails. Your
program breaks up the experiment into two parts: the first part generates
a list of randomly selected 'heads' and 'tails' values, and the second part
checks if there is a streak in it. Put all of this code in a loop that repeats the
experiment 10,000 times so we can find out what percentage of the coin
flips contains a streak of six heads or tails in a row. As a hint, the function
call random.randint(0, 1) will return a 0 value 50% of the time and a 1 value
the other 50% of the time.

You can start with the following template:
__________________________________________________________________________
import random
numberOfStreaks = 0
for experimentNumber in range(10000):
    # Code that creates a list of 100 'heads' or 'tails' values.
    # Code that checks if there is a streak of 6 heads or tails in a row.
print('Chance of streak: %s%%' % (numberOfStreaks / 100))
__________________________________________________________________________
Of course, this is only an estimate, but 10,000 is a decent sample size.
Some knowledge of mathematics could give you the exact answer and save
you the trouble
